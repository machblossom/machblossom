**Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹!** I'm Joshua Mach (he/him), a student from California, USA studying Computer Science and Physics. I enjoy playing a wide variety of instruments like guitar, piano, and bass and have always been interested in all kinds of music ðŸŽ¼! On my free time, I often like to learn about new things within the fields of Physics and Philosophy.
